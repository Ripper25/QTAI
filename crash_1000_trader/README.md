# Crash 1000 Index Trader

This is a specialized trading system for the Crash 1000 Index synthetic instrument. It uses an inverted V pattern detection algorithm to identify profitable trading opportunities.

## Features

- **Real-time Processing**: Processes each new candle as it closes
- **Kelly Criterion Position Sizing**: Optimizes position size based on account balance
- **Broker-Compliant**: Respects the 762-point minimum stops level required by the broker
- **Event-Based**: Subscribes to candle close events rather than using time intervals
- **No Random Trades**: Only places trades when valid patterns are detected in real-time

## Trading Parameters

- **Minimum Volume**: 0.2 lots
- **Maximum Volume**: 120 lots
- **Volume Limit**: 350 lots in one direction
- **Stops Level**: 762 points (minimum distance for take profit)
- **Point Value**: $1.00 per point per standard lot
